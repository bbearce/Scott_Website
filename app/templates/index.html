    <h1>RECIPE</span></h1>
    <p>Medical disclaimer</span></p>
    <p>This is the guide for your more stress free future.</span></p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>The cure to negative Addiction is not impossible. It is a recipe.</span></p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>The recipe contains tips on how to heal the mind as properly and peacefully as possible with a fraction of the pain that comes with traditional detoxing.-The most valuable ingredient is wanting and having the will to try to quit.</span></p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>However, even if you don&rsquo;t have the will to quit, it&rsquo;s important to learn the information for when the time comes when you have no choice but to try to quit. Thus, here at ucureu know how hard this can be and appreciate you for learning. It is vital to keep in mind that with addiction, breakdown is not the end. If you believe you have failed with this program, remember this is not true. You have discovered precious abilities and tricks to help you achieve success in the future.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>The recipe:</span></p>
    <p>-Read the pamphlet of questions and statements aloud several times. Reflecting and trying to align your intentions with the intentions of the writing is key.</span></p>
    <p>-Proceed to crush 4-6 grams of Mushrooms into a pulverized powder and add the contents to a clean and drink the tea</span></p>
    <p>-Continue to read the pamphlet aloud. This will help open your mind to new possibilities.</span></p>
    <p>-Play Mozart music USING HEADPHONES and relax until you fall asleep.</span></p>
    <p>It is important to realize that taking this dose may intensify the feeling of hopelessness and addiction while under the influence. However, it&rsquo;s vital to remember that after you wake up, you should feel better. It will be similar to condensing several cravings into 1 experience.</span></p>
    <p>-Be certain that you are in a safe and clean environment. If you are uncomfortable, cannabis may help you relax during this step.</span></p>
    <p>-Remember that who you are in the past does not have to match the future you.</span></p>
    <p>-Exercise daily from now on. It will allow you to experience a natural high.</span></p>
    <p>-Refrain from using harmful addictions as best you can from now on.</span></p>
    <p>-Repeat these steps every 3-10 days for 3 more times. Adjust the dosage if needed but i feel like more is better</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>If you can&rsquo;t have the belief that you are capable of quitting, try to focus your attention on disliking the substance. Try to realize how hollow it is. Remember how much energy, time, money, and respect it can cost and how it never gets better. Say aloud &ldquo;I hate my addiction&rdquo; several times each day and whenever you have a craving. After some time of doing this repeatedly, you will form the belief that you&rsquo;re capable of quitting.</span></p>
    <p><br></p>
    <h2 >Pamphlet</span></h2>
    <p>after being addicted to hatful substances or beliefs,one &nbsp;must forgive, forget, or suffer</span></p>
    <p>Before someone is a man, woman, white, black, tall, sick, healthy, in hate or love, &nbsp;etc., they&rsquo;re a person. A person is always capable of bettering their future selves and the world around them.</span></p>
    <p>If t the habits/substances/thoughts which bring happiness are also ones which are damaging to yourself and others, its time to try to change your belief structure</span></p>
    <p>When warm summer days become cold winter nights, what choice do you have but to look where your money goes and how your &nbsp;heart grows &nbsp;and ask yourself, &ldquo;is this the right choice for my future?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p>Suffering can be an investment that strengthens oneself. It can show you how much better you can be.</span></p>
    <p>We&rsquo;re all capable and guilty of being dumb confused animals; lacking full intellectual potential. Everyone is &nbsp;largely bred by emotions, beliefs, prejudices, etc. but we&rsquo;re all capable of being better people.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>Those who are seen as &ldquo;bad&rdquo; should acknowledge that some brains were grown by confused prejudiced animals passing down their confusion and prejudice resulting in the blockage of happiness; our parents, teachers and predecessors. We don&rsquo;t have to give into the same habits and ideas from the past.</span></p>
    <p>Its wrong to feed hateful thoughts/habits which harm you or your future. Its right to feed righteous thoughts which which make your future self/world better and healthier.</span></p>
    <p>If you make the mistake of remaking your bad choice/habbit, start with denying yourself a few minutes before each time you use such a choice. Remember making peaceful acceptance, or partnership, with the sickness will soften its intensity. Then try for an hour prolonging the denial longer each time. Then add a smile. Focus on breathing as you remember that your emotions and desires don&rsquo;t have to own you, This too will pass. When one masters this technique with ACTIVE GENUINE MENTAL EFFORT, one has mastered beating sickness and can go days without neither using nor getting sick.</span></p>
    <p>Walk away from the pain and forgive it. You&rsquo;re so special. You will be loved most when you&rsquo;re &nbsp;doing the most right decisions.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>When the craving comes, enter the realization that it can be gone with 20 minutes of quality meditation or exercise. We need to do things right.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>Will you invest in the right choices for a beautiful future(50%self/50%others)?</span></p>
    <p>Human brains cab become so warped sustenance can take the shape of death</span></p>
    <p>Never be ashamed of mistakes in the past. The only shame should lie in the fact that you never tried to better yourself. And your worlds future</span></p>
    <p>Cleanse yourself to discover your true happiness and greatness.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>Forgiving a person could be hurtful, but forgiving and then learning from hardships and damaging events will allow a better chance for self growth and for happiness.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>Does math govern all? Do you think your free will can be governed by mathematics? Why or y not? Would it be nice that if all the things you love and hate, were seen as a product of mathematics? Goodness in healthy thought and mathematics is what binds and elevates us. DNA and circumstance is what separates us.</span></p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>Remember the penny/feather/gravity &nbsp;experiment from school. Remember how the laws of reality treated all objects equally? Then think about a 5 year old dying from a terminal disease vs a 105yr old man dying from old age. Think about how unfair the laws of reality can be to consciousness. Yet, we just discussed how the laws of reality are fair and just to all objects. How can the 2 possibilities reconcile? Maybe, the only way is that one singular consciousness occupies both entities. Then, and only then, life is equal and fair to all consciousness?</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;The most valuable challenge in life is realizing, and trying to modify your emotions and desires into thoughts that benefit your future.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>Regular Exercise brings improved chemical production and can increase happiness.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>Tone/volume of voice is 30-70% of communication.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>The USA is the nation where all the world&apos;s confusion and its prejudices collide with one another so drug addiction is a natural reaction.</span></p>
    <p>Nothing is for free. A breath cost energy. happiness costs at least ACTIVE GENUINE MENTAL EFFORT OF THE IMAGINATION. Beautiful costs</span></p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>There is such a myriad of desire/prejudice towards so many beliefs. Whether those beliefs are represented in people, religions, substances, circumstances, whether one loves or hates each belief representative, wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if you could forgive each and one could just blame all problems in their life on singular thought; the &ldquo;mathematics of inferior/prejudiced past vs circumstance of reality&rdquo;?</span></p>
    <p>Focusing on a belief gives power to a belief over an individual. What would focusing on the belief &ldquo;I must cleanse the system of my thought for the best future&rdquo; produce&rdquo;? What is the cost for cleansing the system of one&rsquo;s thought? What is the prize for cleaning the system of ones thought?</span></p>
    <p>The blind obedience to money, power, religion, people, and gods as gods should be challenged. &nbsp;Only obey the math.</span></p>
    <p>For the sake of the law of choice concept, beliefs are everything thought from physical reality you can sense to memories, fairytales that subconsciously arise, each with a certain strength/reliability factor 0-100.</span></p>
    <p><span >Concept formula for free will</span></p>
    <p>Level of reliability in beliefs, chemical desire and structure0-100%. For example, lets take a normal sane land animals consciousness with a sea creatures. Let&rsquo;s assume both have the beleif/desire structure &ldquo;i have the 3 basic needs&rdquo;, &nbsp;when a fish is pulled out of the water, it will convulse and try to jump back to the sea while it can. When a land-animal is suddenly and surprisingly denied all air, it will also try to get away from the dangerous situation, and eventually convulse if unable. Look how similar the free will, as humans, can be to fish when confronted with the same situation, and understand the law of free will doesn&rsquo;t discriminate between good fish and bad humans. For the sake of the concept to free will formula provided on the Also, notice that for the purposes of this writing, it can be interpreted as both an inner belief and an outer belief with a maximum reliability factor of &ldquo;I will die&rdquo; 100% combined with an essential chemical restriction ( oxygen) of 100% which produces a &ldquo;prejudice of position in reality100&rdquo; in both creatures. It might seem redundant to say that a desire towards one thing is also a prejudice towards its opposite &nbsp;however, since 2 thoughts in agreement &nbsp;usually lead to quicker decision, i think its important to separate the 2 into separate components.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>.The first thing I want to mention is that I cannot provide the law of choice but rather only a concept or description as best I know it. Although the provided concept may be sloppy and lacking, the value of the concept provided lies in the realization that math governs all; including each decision each living being makes. &nbsp;The provided formula is just an elementary attempt to connect all the choices of any living consciousness with a form of singularity.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p>Law of Choice:</span></p>
    <p>Subconscious/memory inner beliefs vs conscious focus</span></p>
    <p>* We are all just reactionary calculators. Free will must have a formula?</span></p>

    <p>[A(belief blueprint imprinted from the past)+B(belief/chemical blueprint imprinted in the present)]U(living conscious &nbsp;being DNA)]= C(calculation/decision(often a chemical/emotional reaction) which aides the beings belief structure in some way for x time)</span></p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>Example of the components at this moment:</span></p>
    <ul>
        <li >Inner belief- being x inches tall, y pounds heavy, z time old, &ldquo;these words might offer a possibility of improving my future by showing a new perception&rdquo;</span></li>
        <li >Outer belief- reading this, the possible fact that you have loved ones who cherish you in the future for making the right decisions</span></li>
        <li >Emotional/chemical- could be anything from fearful and hopeless to curious and in love. Chemically dependent upon anything from love, hate, fear to nicotine, meth</span></li>
        <li >Desire- could be directed at anything from pleasing an entity you respect, and wanting to make the future a better place to improving quality and amount of your own&rsquo;s self happiness/pleasure</span></li>
        <li >Inner prejudice- ranges from current self-position in reality to the hatred of not having enough information about something</span></li>
        <li >Outer prejudices- ranges from religionism and racism to seeing people abuse themselves, their potential legacy and quality of happiness</span></li>
        <li >Addiction- what beliefs are you addicted to? What substances? Oxygen? Doubt? Love? A cigarette user, for example, is often addicted to both their habit thoughts such as &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get smoke/substance free and I&rsquo;m addicted to looking at damaging memories when I try to stop.&rdquo;.&nbsp;</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>Subconscious/memory inner beliefs vs conscious focus. The eternal battle between a search for improved quality of happiness vs what you currently believe is most important.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><br></p>

    <p>Belief</span></p>
    <ul >
        <li >
            <p>Inner beliefs- beliefs directed from the self which consciousness and its senses process.&nbsp;</span></p>
        </li>
        <li >
            <p>Outer beliefs- beliefs from the external. The setting you can see around you now to the entities and life you believe is waiting for you but cannot see.</span></p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&hellip;</span></p>
    <p><span >Desire</span></p>
    <p>Desire is at the core of every conscious being, its basic desires are the elements of life:</span></p>
    <ul >
        <li >
            <p>Safety</span></p>
        </li>
        <li >
            <p>Sex</span></p>
        </li>
        <li >
            <p>Sustenance, &nbsp;Sustenance can be interpreted as the chemicals a body is dependent upon; from love or oxygen up to experiencing an event. How can sustenance can consumed by experiencing an event? When that experience triggers an desired feeling or reaction However, life has a way of transforming the interpretation of the 3 at some point. For example, cigarettes, other detrimental substances may have become a form of one or more of the 3 even though harmful substances were once seen as such. To define how the law of choice each component</span></p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Level of desire- 0-100, at 0, one can say there is no desire. At 100, one can assume the being is completely dependent on that desire; as is with true love or oxygen.</span></p>
    <p>-level of realization and the direction of desired future is often guided by what emotions/chemicals one is addicted to, and how intense they are.</span></p>
    <p>formed by mixture of desire and beliefs; words, experiences, people one experiences forcing them to form inner and outer prejudices. For example, a child who wishes they were older vs an adult who wishes they were younger is an example of inner generational prejudice.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>often, an outer prejudice will breed inner prejudice. For example, take the moment when a child is beng bullied. For that moment, the child will have negative feelings towards the bully, an outer prejudice. when that child makes the decision to walk away or fight back, thats an example of an inner prejudice towards one&rsquo;s self position in reality; the most popular prejudice in conscious thought spread across all animals from all of the Earth&rsquo;s kingdom. For the sake of such a concept formula, prejudice can be synonymous with &ldquo;opposite/anti desire&rdquo;. For example, a person who makes the decision &nbsp;It might seem redundant&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>Inner prejudice-an addiction with characteristics of the self vs reality&rsquo;s circumstances. Examples include :dissatisfaction with selfs: age, appearance, occupation, attitude, etc the most popular prejudice is &ldquo;circumstances of realities self-beliefs vs the present circumstances of reality&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p>Outer prejudice- a product of the self belief vs the circumstantial reality. Examples include racism, religionism, etc.</span></p>
    <p>everyone is addicted to some set of substances, beliefs, and accompanying habits. For example, some people are addicted to overeating or doing drugs while others are addicted to believing healthy thinking will aide their legacy &nbsp;and trying to make themselves better.</span></p>
    <p>What beliefs are you addicted to? What beliefs would improve your future self and your world around you most?</span></p>
    <p>What if a person was suddenly addicted to questions/thoughts like &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have such a better quality of happiness when I quit smoking/substances and stop looking at unhealthy memories? I will always remember to go exercise and/or meditate when the craving, harmful thoughts, substance, or bad event occurs.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p>Ideal mindset:</span></p>
    <ul >
        <li >
            <p>Belief- I know that a greater quality of happiness lies in getting my mind clean and walking away from destructive thoughts which damage my future self greatest and my world?</span></p>
        </li>
        <li >
            <p>Desire-I want to thank god by doing something kind for those around me?</span></p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><br></p>
    <ul >
        <li >
            <p>If the habits/substances/thoughts which bring happiness are also the only ones which are damaging to yourself and others, its time to try to change your belief structure?</span></p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><span >Present Tense Reality - inner point</span></p>
    <p><span >Natural reaction vs choice: there are times when judgement of reaction is questionable. For example, there have been times when animal loving drivers, or otherwise, are driving along the highway when all of a sudden, a live confused animal appears in the headlights. Many drivers swerved to avoid hitting the animal. Swerving along highways can increase the chances of risking their own life as well as any other driver&rsquo;s lives who might have been closeby</span></p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>---Pamphlet Below---</span></p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>Example: Smoking a Cigarette</span></p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>At first you start in the center, in the present. It feels good, and you could say it &quot;helps&quot; you in the short term. Say it gives you an arbitrary &quot;Good Value&quot; (GV) of 5 because you feel relieved of stress and it helps stimulate the mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>It helps noone else though. You could measure this as 0 points for GV. So at this point we are at a total of 5 GV points.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>Now let&apos;s see if there are any negatives. Sort term it harms your respiratory system and we could give that at least a &quot;Bad Value&quot; (BV) of 10. It even harms others if you do it around them so we&apos;ll tack another 10 for a total of 20 BV.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>If we compare our GV to BV we see that this action over all is 4x worse for us than it is better and we are left with 15 BV net.</span></p>
    <p>RATIO = BV/GV = 4.</span></p>
    <p><span >NET = GV - BV = -15 V or 15 BV</span></p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>Natural reaction vs choice: there are times when judgement of reaction is questionable. For example, there have been times when animal loving drivers, or otherwise, are driving along the highway when all of a sudden, a live confused animal appears in the headlights. Many drivers swerved to avoid hitting the animal. Swerving along highways can increase the chances of risking one&rsquo;s own life as well as any other driver&rsquo;s lives who might have been closeby. Obviously, risking one&rsquo;sown life in addition to other drivers is a poor decision vs committing roadkill. Yet, it is a common story many can believe. &nbsp;So time is the differentiating factor here. The difference between a natural reaction vs a choice is time allowance</span></p>
